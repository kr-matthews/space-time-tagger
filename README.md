# Space-Time Tagger

This is an Android app which allows you to tag the current time (and optionally your current location), and store these tags in a list for later review.

The motivating use case is if you're filming something over a long period of time and want a list of key moments to revisit afterwards, without having to skim through the whole video.

It is a work-in-progress.

## Use

The app is not (currently) directly available anywhere, but you can clone/fork this repository and install it on an android phone with developer mode enabled.

## Features

### Current

- Extremely basic UI to add/delete tags to/from a single list - no data is persistent between launches.

### Potential Future

See [enhancements](https://github.com/kr-matthews/space-time-tagger/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement) on GitHub.

- Have a list of 'sessions' of tags, allow navigation between them, and persist them across app launches.
- UI styling.

## Original Intentions

- Build an Android app from scratch - first personal Android project.
- Get more familiar with basic architecture and implement best practices, including tests - prior experience has all been modifying _existing_ apps.
- A relatively basic, but still useful Android app.

## Focus

- Android architecture.
- Clean code.
- Tests.
- Clean git history, with a functional app at all points.
- Android permissions - location in particular.

## Flaws

See the [issues](https://github.com/kr-matthews/space-time-tagger/issues) on GitHub, in addition to the following:

- (currently too early to list flaws, but I'm sure there will be many soon enough)
